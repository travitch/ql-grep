# Find uses of strcmp in a C/C++ file that does not include string.h
#
# This is useful for ensuring include hygiene (i.e., that files do not depend on
# transitive includes to compile)
#
# This tests that the relational rewriting works and that the
# typechecking/compilation/evaluation around relational values works as expected.
